Delete Salesforce standard Site content
=======================================

This is an Apache ANT script using the Salesforce Metadata API, that makes deleting of the standard Salesforce site content a breeze, compared to manually deleting all content. You only need 2 simple commands, and a few steps.

Install Apache ANT and the Salesforce Metadata Jar
--------------------------------------------------

Before being able to use the script, you need to have Java, Apache ANT and the Salesforce Metadata Jar installed, more about that in the Salesforce.com documentation: [Force.com Migration Tool Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.daas.meta/daas/forcemigrationtool_install.htm)

Create your site
----------------

Next you create your Salesforce Site, by creating your site, salesforce generates Apex Classes, VisualForce Components, VisualForce Pages and a Static Resource. Next you change the Site's error pages, and remove all the default pages, replace them with your own.

Before running the scripts
----------------

Before running the scripts, you will need to fill in the Salesforce username and password in the build.properties file. Also, make sure that the Salesforce Metadata Jar file is accessible for your ANT installation by either:

1. Placing the JAR file in the lib folder of your ANT installation
  
2. Adding an extra argument to the commands described hereunder, like so: ```ant retrieve -lib \path\to\JAR```

Make a backup
-------------

Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
Before deleting everything, if you want you can make a backup of all the standard components by doing the following commands:

```ant retrieve```

Deploy empty files
------------------

Because of cross references you can't actually delete everything first, so you must deploy empty values of the files, before being able to delete.

```ant deployempty```

Delete the files
----------------

Finally the point we have been waiting for, deleting the content.

```ant delete```
